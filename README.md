# Trapped

## Description:

Trapped is a 2D survival created without the use of a conventional game engine. 

The game was made in 5 days as a submission to  @serci98's Monthly GameJam #6 on itch.io (you can find the gamejam linked below).

The game was programmed with C/C++ using the Raylib library, OpenGL, and my own personalized library for extra functionality.

All assets/artwork were created by me using libresprite.

Currently majority of production on the game has been finalized with minor updates from time to time.
